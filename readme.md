    - Signia has unveiled its new Nx hearing system — and it is revolutionizing the hearing aid industry! After 50 years of research and development, German engineers have found a way to pack cutting-edge technology in a device so small, it disappears behind or inside your ear. The old hearing aids of the past were highly visible and only made sounds louder. These new hearing systems are mini computers that can pick up voices and reduce background noise automatically. The new Nx technology uses a unique algorithm that is clinically proven to deliver better than normal hearing. This allows you to understand your family and friends clearly, even in crowded restaurants. And with the touchControl App, you can control settings and personalize your preferences directly from your smartphone. We at hear.com want you to be one of the first to experience this amazing technology.
